Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

code: 

git clone <repository_url>

Clone the repository into a newly created folder where you want to keep your project.

Create a Virtual Environment:

Navigate to the parent folder where you just cloned the repository and create a virtual environment using virtualenv.

code:

virtualenv <desired_env_name>

Activate the Virtual Environment:

On PowerShell, activate the virtual environment using the following command:

code:

 <desired_env_name>\Scripts\Activate
Install Dependencies:

Move to the projects folder within the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using pip.

code:

cd <project_folder>
pip install -r requirements.txt
