# Django Blog Template

Welcome to the **Django Blog Template**! This is a simple and customizable template for creating your own blog using the Django web framework.

## Getting Started

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Clone the repository into a newly created folder where you want to keep your project.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    Navigate to the parent folder where you just cloned the repository and create a virtual environment using virtualenv.

    ```
    virtualenv <desired_env_name>
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    On PowerShell, activate the virtual environment using the following command:

    ```
    <desired_env_name>\Scripts\Activate
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

    Move to the projects folder within the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using pip.

    ```
    cd <project_folder>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

    Finally, start the Django development server by running the following command:

    ```
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    This will launch the blog on [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).
